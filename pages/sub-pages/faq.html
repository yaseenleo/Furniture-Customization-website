                        <h5 class="faq-info-heading">How do I design my closet?</h5>
                        <p class="faq-info-detail">We offer two ways to design your closet organizer using our closet design tools or request a free
                            personal closet design from our professional design team. <a href="../customize.html">Click Here to Design a Closet

                        <h5 class="faq-info-heading">Does your closet system stand on the floor or hang on the wall?</h5>
                        <p class="faq-info-detail">Our wall hung closet systems hang from the wall from a steel rail that is secured to your house’s
                            framing. Our system can easily hold up to 1200 lbs. Because it is attached to the wall, it allows
                            for additional floor storage and makes it easy to vacuum your closet. Unlike floor mounted closet
                            systems, our closet organizers do not require you to cut around or alter the moldings in your
                            closet. And because it's off the floor, there's no need for you to shim to compensate for sloping
                            floors or irregular walls in your closet.
                        </p>

                        <h5 class="faq-info-heading">Why is the top shelf at 84 inches?</h5>
                        <p class="faq-info-detail">Our closet systems use a standard top shelf height of 84 inches or 7 feet. This is based on a
                            typical ceiling height of 96 inches or 8 feet and leaves a foot of usable shelf space the full
                            length of the top shelf in your closet. The usable height for our standard hanging sections is
                            based on this 84 inch height, (double hang is 40” top and bottom, tall hang is 65”, medium hang
                            is 50 to 55” and short hang is 40”) and work well for people up to the height of 6 feet. If you
                            are taller than this, the design for your closet organizer can certainly be customized in our
                            design tool to accommodate your height or unique ceiling height. You may also give our design
                            team a call during business hours at 1-800-910-0129, option 3 and they can access your saved
                            design to assist you with top shelf height adjustments.</p>

                        <h5 class="faq-info-heading">What are the closets made of? Are they strong?</h5>
                        <p class="faq-info-detail">Our closet organizers are made of high quality ¾" furniture-grade composite panels. The surface
                            is a thermally fused laminate that is baked on and not just glued. The wall-mounted systems hang
                            on a durable steel rail that you secure to your house’s framing. An 8-foot section can hold up
                            to 1,200 pounds when properly installed. See our product specifications and Lifetime Limited
                            Warranty details.
                        </p>

                        <h5 class="faq-info-heading">How much does an average closet cost?</h5>
                        <p class="faq-info-detail">Because our closet system is customized and we offer so many colors, finishes and design options
                            tailored to your needs, we are not able to quote average pricing. We are not a franchise, so
                            we pay no franchise fees or royalties. Remember that all our prices include free shipping, our
                            closet organizers are guaranteed and our customer service is available to you before, during
                            and after your purchase.
                        </p>

                        <h5 class="faq-info-heading">How deep are your units?</h5>
                        <p class="faq-info-detail">Our standard closet units are 14" Deep. This is the closet industry standard. In certain situations,
                            we can modify the depth of our units. Please call to request this special service.
                        </p>

                        <h5 class="faq-info-heading">Are your closet systems adjustable? Can I change my design down the road if I need to?</h5>
                        <p class="faq-info-detail">Absolutely! Regular shelves sit on pins and are easily adjusted. Our locking cam shelves and hanging
                            rods are adjusted up or down easily with a screwdriver. Changing the width of sections in your
                            closet will require the purchase of new shelves. If you want to ensure adjustability for your
                            design before purchasing, or think you may want to add drawers or baskets to your closet organizer
                            at a future point, it is a good idea to give our design team a call at 1-800-910-0129, option
                            3 during business hours before you buy so they may review your design with this in mind. If you
                            have purchased your closets already, and want to make a change, please give our Customer Service
                            Team a call at 1-800-218-2492 during business hours and they will assist you.
